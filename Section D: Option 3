# Student Feedback
I would contact the student regarding the submissions and explain to them in detail what the issue
was with their task and how they can improve or resolve the issues they had with the task.
I would give them proper guidance to ensure that they have a well understanding of what they have
to do to get their task marked as complete. 

If I have finished handling the students submission I would ask them to take down there negative 
feedback or apologize on social media. This would also teach the student that if they do something
wrong they can just ask for guidance and that they do not have to get angry when they do always
get everything right.
